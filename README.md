### Setup and Run Instructions

Follow these steps to get the project up and running:

#### 1. Install Dependencies

First, ensure all project dependencies are installed by running:

```bash
npm install
```
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Note:** If you haven't already, make sure TypeScript is globally installed on your machine:

```bash
npm install -g typescript
```

#### 2. Start the Application

To start the application, use the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

By default, the server will run on **Port 3000**. If you'd like to change the port, you can do so by modifying the `server.ts` file. However, it's recommended to manage the port configuration via an environment variable or a configuration file for better flexibility and maintainability.
